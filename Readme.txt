This would have much better off gone into a blog where one has control over pretty much everything and can, for instance, set the font and a lot of other formatting options so that it does not really look gay ;-), Nothing against gay people, though.

Now that this blog currently does not exist, default Github is a decent way to save work which definitely took a lot of effort and time to pull off.

It actually looks easier to first write markdown the later export to HMTL so yes, markdown then later HTML.
