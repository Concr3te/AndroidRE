This is my second attempt at reverse engineering. My first attempt at Reverse Engineering was probably done around 3 years ago, just around the same time of the year and around very late in the previous year. The attempt was at reverse engineering a Windows application, to be more specific, Metatrader, an application that is used for trading currencies, shares etc etc. It has an online store which has a lot of automated traders but which go for a price. My attempt, then had mostly to do
with checking for the possibility of using the automated traders without having to pay for them. It turned out that these folks were more than prepared for this, though and the application contained all sorts of mechanisms to hinder reverse engineering, including but not limited to obfuscation, which turned out to be the hardest to get around.
